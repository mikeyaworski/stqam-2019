\section*{Engineering Test Suites}
We are going to move onto the second part of the course. In the first
part of the course, you learned ways to make sure that your test
suites are exhaustive enough.  In this part of the course, you will
learn about making your test suites better as engineered artifacts.

\paragraph{Why tests?} Let's start by talking about what test suites can do for you (as a developer).

Reference: Kat Busch. ``A beginner's guide to automated testing.'' \\
\url{https://hackernoon.com/treat-yourself-e55a7c522f71}

\paragraph{Anecdote: ``TODO: write tests.''} We're all busy, right?
Surely tests are less important than writing actual code to solve problems.
And it can be hard to set up the test.

When you're writing code, you clearly want to know that it can at least
work. So you may have a development setup. Kat Busch describes writing 
a Java server to interface with an Android app. Her development setup
involved manual testing:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
\item set up test server on dev machine;
\item install app on test phone;
\item manually create a test case on test phone.
\end{itemize}
She writes: ``Obviously I didn't test very many code paths because it was just so tedious.''

Since Dropbox (her employer at the time) used code review, she actually had
to write tests to pass code review, even if it was annoying to do so.

``Lo and behold, I soon needed to fix a small bug.'' But, of course, 
it's easy to introduce even more bugs when fixing something.
Fortunately, she had some tests.

\begin{quote}
I ran the tests. Within a few seconds, I knew that everything still worked! Not just a single code path (as in a manual test), but all code paths for which I’d written tests! It was magical. It was so much faster than my manual testing. And I knew I didn’t forget to test any edge cases, since they were all still covered in the automated tests.
\end{quote}

Not writing tests is incurring technical debt. You'll pay for it
later, when you have to maintain the code. Having tests
allows you to move faster later, without worrying about breaking your
code.

Writing tests is like eating your vegetables. It'll enable your code to go big and strong.
