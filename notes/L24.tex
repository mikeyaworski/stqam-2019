\lecture{24 --- March 18, 2019}{Winter 2019}{Patrick Lam}{version 2}

We'll continue discussing how to engineer your test suites today. 
In particular, we'll see more details on how to make behaviour verification
actually happen (using mock objects); we'll discuss the bane of flaky tests;
and we'll talk about continuous integration.

\section*{Test Doubles}
Mock objects are a particular kind of test double. We need test doubles
because objects collaborate with other objects, but we only want to test
one object at a time.
Meszaros categorizes test doubles as follows:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item dummy objects: these are not actually test doubles; they don't do anything, but just take up space in parameter lists. Are like {\tt null}, but get past nullness checks in code.
    \item fake objects: have actual behaviour (which is correct), but somehow unsuitable for use in production; typical example is an in-memory database.
    \item stubs: produce canned answers in response to interactions from the class under test.
    \item mocks: like stubs, also produce canned answers. Difference: mock objects also check that the class under test makes the appropriate calls.
    \item spies: usually wraps the real object (instead of the mock, which stubs it), and records interactions for later verification.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Mock Objects}
Before we talk about mock objects, let's look at a stub. Imagine that you have a service that
sends out emails. You don't actually want to send out emails while you're testing. So here's
a class that pretends to send out emails.
\begin{lstlisting}
public class MailServiceStub implements MailService {
  private List<Message> messages = new ArrayList<Message>();
  public void send (Message msg) {
    messages.add(msg);
  }
  public int numberSent() {
    return messages.size();
  }
}     
\end{lstlisting}
This stub permits \emph{state verification}, as seen in the following assert in a test:
\begin{lstlisting}
  assertEquals(1, mailer.numberSent());
\end{lstlisting}
This is state verification because it's checking the contents of
memory (which should reflect interactions that have happened in the
past). One could also check the recipients, contents of messages, etc.

\paragraph{jMock example.} 
Instead of state verification, we can also do behaviour verification. This is
jMock syntax.
\begin{lstlisting}
class OrderInteractionTester... {
  public void testOrderSendsMailIfUnfilled() {
    Order order = new Order(TALISKER, 51);
    Mock warehouse = mock(Warehouse.class);
    Mock mailer = mock(MailService.class);
    order.setMailer((MailService) mailer.proxy());

    mailer.expects(once()).method("send");
    warehouse.expects(once()).method("hasInventory")
      .withAnyArguments()
      .will(returnValue(false));

    order.fill((Warehouse) warehouse.proxy());
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
The calls to {\tt mock()} create mock objects which have the
appropriate type.  If you are using the objects as simple dummy
objects, calling {\tt mock()} and {\tt proxy()} is enough. Note that
we have a real {\tt Order} object but we're giving it the fake proxy
objects, as created by the {\tt Mock}'s {\tt proxy()} methods.

We also specify the expected behaviour of the {\tt mailer} and the
{\tt warehouse}. The test case is saying that the mailer ought to have
{\tt send()} called on it once, and that the warehouse ought to have
{\tt hasInventory()} called; that method should return {\tt false()}.

\paragraph{EasyMock example.} Different mock object libraries have different syntax. Here's 
another example, this time for EasyMock.

\begin{lstlisting}
@RunWith(EasyMockRunner.class)
public class ExampleTest {

  @TestSubject
  private ClassUnderTest classUnderTest = new ClassUnderTest();

  @Mock // creates a mock object
  private Collaborator mock;

  @Test
  public void testRemoveNonExistingDocument() {
    replay(mock);
    classUnderTest.removeDocument("Does not exist");
  }
}      
\end{lstlisting}
Here we are testing the {\tt ClassUnderTest} and creating a mock object
of {\tt Collaborator} type. EasyMock 2.3 reads the {\tt @Mock} annotation
and automatically fills in a mock object of the appropriate type.
In our test case, we call {\tt replay(mock)} to indicate that we are no
longer recording expectations, but are instead starting the test case itself.
In the above code, there are currently no expectations.

Let's add some expectations.
\begin{lstlisting}
@Test
public void testAddDocument() {
  // ** recording phase **
  // expect document addition
  mock.documentAdded("Document");
  // expect to be asked to vote for document removal, and vote for it
  expect(mock.voteForRemoval("Document"))
             .andReturn((byte) 42);
  // expect document removal
  mock.documentRemoved("Document");
  replay(mock);
  // ** replaying phase ** we expect the recorded actions to happen
  classUnderTest.addDocument("New Document", new byte[0]);
  // check that the behaviour actually happened:
  verify(mock);
}
\end{lstlisting}
Here we record the fact that the mock should be called with {\tt documentAdded}
and a parameter "New Document". We also record that the mock's 
{\tt voteForRemoval} method should be called, and when that happens, it should return
value 42.
Finally, we add a call {\tt verify()} to let EasyMock
know that we're done and that it can go ahead and check that the expected behaviour actually happened.

\section*{Flaky Tests}
The second test engineering topic I want to talk about today is flaky tests. 
Flaky tests are those that sometimes fail (nondeterministically).
Flakiness is not something you want in your test cases. 
(I have heard one defense of a flaky test: it lets you know that 
the system has the potential to actually work.) 
In general, flaky tests don't play well with the expectation that
your test suite passes 100\%.

\paragraph{Dealing with flaky tests.} Companies with large test suites have found mitigations
for the flaky test suite problem. One can label known-flaky tests as flaky and automatically
re-run them to see if they eventually pass. One can also ignore or remove flaky tests.
But this is unsatisfactory: it takes a long time to re-run failing tests.

\paragraph{Causes of flakiness.} Luo et al studied 201 fixes to flaky tests in open-source
projects. They found that the three most common causes of fixable flaky tests were:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item improper waits for asynchronous responses;
    \item concurrency; and
    \item test order dependency.
\end{enumerate}

The problem that caused flakiness for asynchronous waits was that there was typically a
{\tt sleep()} call which didn't wait long enough for the action (perhaps a network call)
to finish. The best practice is to use some sort of {\tt wait()} call to wait for the result
instead of hardcoding a sleep time.

Concurrency problems were what one might expect. The problem could either be in the system under
test or in the test itself. Problems included data races, atomicity violations, and deadlocks;
the solutions were the proper use of concurrency primitives (e.g. locks) as seen in your 
Operating Systems course.

Test order dependency problems arose when some tests expected other tests to have already
executed (and left a side effect like a file in the filesystem). They came up especially 
in the transition from Java 6 to Java 7 because that transition changed the (not-guaranteed)
test execution order. The solution is to remove the dependency.
